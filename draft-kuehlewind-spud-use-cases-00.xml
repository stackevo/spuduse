   <section anchor="udp" title="UDP firewall traversal">
       <section title="Problem Statement">
           <t>Today UDP is often blocked (“99% of UDP is garbage”) but volume of (good) UDP traffic grows, e.g. RTCWEB uses UDP for data and media. Hard to establish session/flow state at firewalls as block rules are stateless. Therefore we need an explicit contract to establish state along the path (as today’s implicit contract does with TCP).</t>
       </section>
       <section title="Information Exposure">
           <t>Use of identifiers (“tubes”) beyond the five-tuple to link packets together; Explicit ignaling/negotiation of tube start/end: Indicate start/stop to middlebox and confirm connection establishment by receiver.</t>

           <t>e.g. explicit indication of data rate for CBR traffic: video traffic could provide maximum rate with current encoding; network could expose rate shaping to simplify probing; endhost/network could provide indication of sudden changes in bandwidth demand/offer</t>

           <t>explicit indication of loss- vs. latency-sensitive traffic: loss-sensitive traffic faces larger buffer delay,but lower loss rate (tradeoff)</t>
